# Tax-Calculator results when using TMD input data

This folder contains run2N-YY.tables files generated by using
different versions of the three TMD input files with the
Tax-Calculator CLI.  The idea is to make an historical record of how
2022-2035 results change as the TMD data are updated and improved.

## Using `tmd21-files.zip` input files and Tax-Calculator 6.0.0

The private `tmd21-files.zip` file contains TMD input files generated
at the end of the 2024 phase that used 2021 IRS statistics as targets.

After unzipping the `tmd21-files.zip` file in this folder, the
`run21-YY.tables` files (for YY=21,22,...,34,35) are generated as
follows:

```
(base) results> tc --version

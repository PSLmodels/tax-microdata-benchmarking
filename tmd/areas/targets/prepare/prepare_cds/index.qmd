# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This R project constructs subnational area targets for Congressional districts.

In addition, it creates a local web page that a user can upload to a web service if desired. An in-progress version can be viewed on the web [here](https://tmd-areas-prepare-cd-targets.netlify.app/). During development, it may not be identical to what your clone creates.

This R project is part of the larger tax-microdata-benchmarking project, and is in the subfolder "tmd/areas/targets/prepare/".
